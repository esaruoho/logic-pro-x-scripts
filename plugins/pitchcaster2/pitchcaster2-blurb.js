Killer Solos Pitchcaster 2 v0.0

This is not an upgrade to Pitchcaster but rather a variation that employs a modified approach to picking the pitch a changed note will receive.

Logic Pro is an instrument. It's the one I play better than any other.  If you're willing to go there, Pitchcaster and Pitchcaster 2 are themselves new kinds of instruments.

Beware MIDI loops.  Watch the video, YouTube user bitwonk.

Copy this file by doing option-A, option-C in Text Editor.  

Then in Logic add a MIDI effect to a mixer channel and select scripter.  

Hit Save As... Killer Solos Pitchcaster 2.

Then click on Open Script in Editor and in the editor, select all (option-A) and hit backspace to wipe out what's there, hit option-V to paste in the program, and off you go.

Sorry this is clumsy but it's easier to deal with programs as text and the format Logic uses to save scripts into isn't text.

Eventually there should be something better.
