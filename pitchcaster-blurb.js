Killer Solos Pitchcaster v1.0

Beware MIDI loops.  Watch the video, YouTube user bitwonk.

Copy this file by doing option-A, option-C in Text Editor.  

Then in Logic add a MIDI effect to a mixer channel and select scripter.  

Hit Save As... Killer Solos Pitchcaster.

Then click on Open Script in Editor and in the editor, select all (option-A) and hit backspace to wipe out what's there, hit option-V to paste in the program, and off you go.

Sorry this is clumsy but it's easier to deal with programs as text and the format Logic uses to save scripts into isn't text.

Eventually there should be something better.
